This is ongoing work to port Firefox to the musl C library. Currently it
doesn't work, but compiles, so that's a start.

prereqs/ contains build scripts for the prerequisites, configured to build with
musl-cross compilers from http://bitbucket.org/GregorR/musl-cross . Just set up
its config.sh and run ./build.sh to build prereqs.

To build Firefox itself, check out your favorite branch of Firefox from
Mercurial into 'src', then use Mercurial's mq extension to apply the patches:

$ ln -s ../../patches src/.hg/patches
$ cd src
$ hg qpush -a

Configure it how you'd like

$ cp ../mozconfig .mozconfig
$ vim .mozconfig

And build:

$ make -f client.mk
